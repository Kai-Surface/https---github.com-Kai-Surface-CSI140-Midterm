             <p>When snow and ice melt, they reveal darker surfaces underneath which absorbs solar radiation rather than reflecting it. 
                This is called the <b>albedo affect</b> and is one of the reasons why the arctic is warming faster than earth as a whole. 
                Russia makes up for 53% of the arctic ocean coastline and has one of the most populated arctic regions of the arctic countries. 
                Because of the massive country’s characteristics of being a large landmass near one of the poles, it is warming at an alarming rate. 
                While the Earth is in general is warming at a rate of about 0.18°C degrees per decade since the 80s, Russia is warming 0.42°C per decade since the mid-70s. 
                That’s <b>~2.5 times the global average</b>.</p>

                <p>The Russian communities of the arctic (which amount to <b>2.5 million Russians</b>) are being hit the hardest by climate change;
                 and, as the largest arctic communities reside in Russia and <b>almost half of the arctic population is Russian</b>, Russia is arguably the most climate-affected arctic country. 
                 On top of that, Russia’s arctic, Siberian, and far east regions have faced chronic economic underdevelopment for some time, making the blows of global warming hit even harder.</p>

               <p>Permafrost is a layer of permanently frozen ground, or ground that has been frozen since the last ice age 11,000 years ago. 
                <b>Two thirds of Russia is covered in permafrost</b> and built upon it and over 15 million Russians live in homes that were built atop permafrost. 
                It is the glue that holds the north together. Potentially the biggest climate problem the world is facing today is the melting of this ground that has been frozen for thousands of years. 
                Not only does melting permafrost destabilize the ground, destroys buildings, roads, powerlines, and anything else built upon it (which has Russia potentially facing the equivalent of $97 billion by 2050 in infrastructure damage), 
                but it also <b>exacerbates the albedo affect</b> and releases CO2 and methane, creating this <b>exponentially vicious warming cycle</b>. Other climate issues such as increased forest fires contribute to melting permafrost.</p>

               <p>Desertification is another gargantuan environmental problem. It is the process in which land loses its fertility and nutrients, thus becoming unable to support biodiversity and <b>turning all kinds of biomes into deserts</b>. 
                Soil erosion exacerbated by bad agriculture and poor land-use, overuse of fertilizers, and increasingly intense drought and wildfires that are frequently becoming too much for the land to recover from are its main causes. 
                In Russia, it is drying up the land and causing <b>lakes and farmlands to turn into sandy dunes</b>. Livestock have been increasingly dying of starvation after <b>long droughts leave grazing grounds grassless</b>. 
                In the Kalmykia Republic of southern Russia alone, the <b>desert has expanded to double what it was in 2020</b>. The nomadic tribes and livestock dependent communities of these regions are suffering great losses because of desertification.</p>

                <h4>Climate Models</h4>
            <p>Climate models are a type of software that map weather patterns long-term. They allow scientist to test different environmental factors, such as adding or subtracting greenhouse gases, to better understand how the climate is changing through realistic simulations. 
                Currently, the climate is extremely complex and even the most powerful computers struggle to accurately simulate it. This is why it must continue to develop, as the more precise the simulations are the better our understanding of the climate will be.</p>
            <h4>Monitoring Technology</h4>
            <p>This myriad of technology has the purpose of collecting data that would be used to fuel software technology like climate models. 
                In Russia in particular, monitoring stations include 30-meter-deep wells to measure the rate that the permafrost is melting.</p>
